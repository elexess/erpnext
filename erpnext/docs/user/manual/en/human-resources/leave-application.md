# Leave Application

If your company has a formal system where Employees have to apply for leaves
to be able to qualify as paid leaveas, you can create Leave Application to
track approval and usage of leaves. You have to mention the Employee, Leave
Type and the period for which the leave is taken.

###Setting Leave Approver

* A leave approver is a user who can approve an leave application for an employee.

* You need to mention a list of Leave Approvers against an Employee in the Employee Master.

> Tip : If you want all users to create their own Leave Applications, you can set
their “Employee ID” as a match rule in the Leave Application Permission
settings. See the earlier discussion on [Setting Up Permissions](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/users-and-permissions/user-permissions.html)
for more info.
